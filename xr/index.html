Your coverage was so predictable:<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;• someone was seen in McDonalds<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;• upon confiscating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTfdUrlj-gk">80 tonnes</a> of equipment someone used a diesel generator<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;• someone was using something wrapped in plastic <em>(everything is plastic these days)</em><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;• someone was late to work or pickup kids from school<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;• someone blocked public transport <em>(understand your frustration)</em><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;• Police spend money policing <em>(it is their decision, not ours)</em><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;• We actualy won the court case against the Police, the Police decision was unlawful<sup><a href="#fn0" id="ref0">0</a></sup><br>
</p>


<h2>Sorry, not sorry, about the disruption</h2>
<p>
We are sorry that we are portrayed in some mainstream media as annoying.<br><br>

The reality is - our actions are the wake up call, disrupting "business as usual".<br><br>

Non violent direct Action (NVDA) is the most efficient <em>(scientifically proven)</em> tactic to disrupt and put the pressure on the government.<br><br>

Some notable examples from the history:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;• <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmeline_Pankhurst">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmeline_Pankhurst</a><br>
</p>

<blockquote>Pankhurst, her daughters, and other WSPU activists received repeated prison sentences, where they staged hunger strikes to secure better conditions, and were often force-fed.</blockquote>

<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;• <a hrref="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi</a><br><br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;• <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_Parks">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_Parks</a><br><br>

The stakes are much higher now, no longer about a certain group of people, it is about the collapse of society and survival of civilisation.</p>

<h2>Three demands</h2>
<p>
Extinction Rebellion has three demands. Seven words, essence, simplicity:<br>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;• <strong>TELL THE TRUTH</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;• <strong>ACT NOW</strong><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;• <strong>BEYOND POLITICS</strong><br>

We invite conversation based on these three premises.<br><br>

We do not care if you like us or not, it's totally beyond the point.<br><br>

Climate emergency will not be solved by ignoring or arresting bunch of activists: doctors, teachers, olympians, priests, rabbis, members of the European Parliament among many others.

<h2>Systematic Issues</h2>
<p>
• Fossil fuels industry has a long history of sponsoring climate change denial<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup><br>

• "The Great Hack"<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup> tells the story of fake news and unprecedented Facebook data misuse.<br>

• Oxford Dictionaries declared "post-truth" as word of the year<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup><br>

• Amygdala that evolved over thousands of years and fear response to negative news.<br>

• Clickbait titles, few seconds attention span, shows like Naked Attraction<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>.<br>

• Check this Kickstarter project, it's so good: <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/joshfoxtthc/rally-the-truth-help-us-fund-the-truth-has-changed-tour/description">The Truth Has Changed"</a><br>

</p>


<h2>Rules</h2>
<p>
• Doctors have Hippocratic Oath<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup><br>

• Lawyers in the UK have duty to the court in the administration of justice<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>.<br>

• Is Journalist's Creed<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup> a thing in media?<br>
</p>

<h2>Illustrative example</h2>

<img src="images/false-balance.jpg">


<h2>Illustrative example</h2>
<p>Someone will be late to work.<br>Someone will be stuck in traffic.<br>Some distruption is necessary to get the attention.<br>4 years election cycle is not going to work.<br>This is an emergency and has to be treated as such.</p>

<h2>Illustrative example</h2>
<p>Other organisations may piggyback on Extinction Rebellion and do not follow the principles.<br>Extinction Rebellion is strictly non-violent.<br>Verify the sources.<br>Verify the information with the headquarters, information hub, a dedicated media liaison.</p>

<h2>Illustrative example</h2>
<p>Across 50 countries, at least 2 weeks, 100k people someone somewhere will die.<br>This is pure math and the the law of large numbers.<br>Do not seek sensationalist headlines.</p>

<h2>Recommendation</h2>
<p>Talk with a dedicated media liaison.<br>It is perfectly possible that a "random person" could be an undercover law enforcement officer.<br>Don't use out of context soundbites.</p>

<h2>Recommendation</h2>
<p>Subscribe to the announcement channel: <strong><a href="https://t.me/rebellionbroadcast">t.me/rebellionbroadcast</a></strong><br>It's official. It's public.</p>

<h2>Recommendation</h2>
<p>Change the language.<br>
No more climate <s>change</s>. From now on, it's climate <span style="color:red; font-weight: bold;">emergency</span>.<br>
Change is good, everything is changing. <br>
Warming is good, I like Summer.<br>
Biodiversity loss and species going extinct? Well… It’s adaptation (lack thereof) and evolution.<br>
I'm genuinely worried about feedback loops and catasthropic failure, check what happened to Venus<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup>:</p>


<blockquote>“It is thought that the early environment of Venus was more like that of Earth with liquid water on the surface. At some point in the evolution of Venus, a runaway greenhouse effect occurred, leading to the current greenhouse-dominated atmosphere. Venus's atmosphere has therefore received a great deal of attention from those studying climate change on Earth.”</blockquote>

<p>
It's not an alarmist view.<br>

It's facts, research, data, science.<br>

</p>


<!-- <h2>Recommendation</h2>
<p>
You know what is coming.<br>

Reach out to the local group and ask for more information.<br>

Publish materials about planned Extinction Rebellion actions before the event.<br>

Your audience will appreciate proactive approach.<br>

It will be on the news anyway.<br>
