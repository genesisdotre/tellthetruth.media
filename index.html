<h2>Current status</h2>

<p>
  • Measurements with delay<br>
  • Scientific papers with delay<br>
  • IPCC reports with delay<br>
  • Climate itself acts with delay<br>
  • Rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic

<h2>Politicised process</h2>
<p>
  Impossible to get unanimous consensus among 200 parties:<br>
  
  • Russia - UN Security Council veto<br>
  • Saudi Arabia, Quatar - oil<br>
  • Brazil, Argentina - beef<br>
  • United States - previous president climate change denier

<h2>Decades of misinformation</h2>

<h2>What is at stake</h2>
<p>
• collapse of life support systems<br>
• irreversible changes destabilizing the societies and causing mass migration<br>

  Snippet from the <a href="https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/current-time/">2020 Doomsday Clock</a> statement:<br>

  <i>&quot;Nuclear war and climate change are major threats to the physical world. But information is an essential aspect of human interaction, and threats to the information ecosphere—especially when coupled with the emergence of new destabilizing technologies in artificial intelligence, space, hypersonics, and biology—portend a dangerous and multifaceted global instability.&quot;</i>

<h2>Independent media</h2>

<p>

Use your sensemaking. Find voices outside of the establishment, beyond an illusion of choice.<br>

<i>"Russian-British businessman, who owns the Evening Standard and ESTV (London Live). He is also an investor in The Independent"</i><br>
<br>
<i>"He derives his wealth from his father, Alexander Lebedev, a Russian oligarch and former KGB officer"</i><br>
<br>
<i>"The New York Times wrote in 2022, »nobody is a better example of the cosy ties between Russians and the [British] establishment than Mr Lebedev.«"</i><br>

<h2>Blocking public transport and ambulance</h2>
<p>
  At some point, somewhere, somehow, there were isolated incidents.

  I assume no wrongdoing. Of course 

  It's just like saying that "someone died at Glastonbury", in a town of 200 thousand, statistically speaking someone dies

</p>


Kerala model
US Hollywood propaganda arm


UK industrial revolution

UK climate revolution

UK ripe for revolution
Not burning down
Not blowing up
Converting into the museum of the old systems


These rooms.

Surrounded by the energy of from 200 years ago.

Tradition yes - that's why museum.
